# dml (Distance Metric Learning in R)

R package for state-of-the-art algorithms for *Distance Metric Learning*, including global and local methods such as *Relevant Component Analysis*, *Discriminative Component Analysis*, *Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis*, etc. These distance metric learning methods are widely applied in feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, clustering, classification, information retrieval, and computer vision problems.

## Install the current release from CRAN:
```{R}
install.packages('dml')
```

## Install the latest development version from github:
```{R}
devtools::install_github('terrytangyuan/dml')
```

## Examples:
For examples of Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis, please take a look at the separate package [here](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/lfda). For examples of all other implemented algorithms, please take a look at the dml [package reference manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dml/dml.pdf). 

## Brief Intro

Distance metric is widely used in the machine learning literature. We used to choose a distance metric according to a priori (Euclidean Distance , L1 Distance, etc.) or according to the result of cross validation within small class of functions (e.g. choosing order of polynomial for a kernel). Actually, with priori knowledge of the data, we could learn a more suitable distance metric with (semi-)supervised distance metric learning techniques. dml is such an R package aims to implement the state-of-the-art algorithms for (semi-)supervised distance metric learning. These distance metric learning methods are widely applied in feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, clustering, classification, information retrieval, and computer vision problems.

## Algorithms

Algorithms planned in the first development stage:

  * Supervised Global Distance Metric Learning:
  
    * Relevant Component Analysis (RCA) - implemented
    * Kernel Relevant Component Analysis (KRCA)
    * Discriminative Component Analysis (DCA) - implemented
    * Kernel Discriminative Component Analysis (KDCA)
    * Global Distance Metric Learning by Convex Programming - implemented

  * Supervised Local Distance Metric Learning:
